# Verilog-Projects
Collection of verilog modules and projects

Some of them are purely simulations and others require real hardware.
Some have diagrams done in https://github.com/hneemann/Digital.

Note: the "board" selected in each project is irrelevant because I'm only running a simulation and not attempting to upload to board. This simply allows apio to build.

```
> apio init --board TinyFPGA-B2
> apio build
> apio sim
```
